        <h1> The Cottage Garden </h1>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p> The <span class="style tree">cottage garden</span></i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a misture of omamental and edible plants.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p> The Cottage Garden originated in <u class="tree">England</u> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structure and rigorously maintained <u class="tree">English estate gardens</u>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p> The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.
